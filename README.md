# PegelOnline - Tech4Germany | Coding Challenge
Please find the original problem satement and use case here: https://github.com/tech4germany/coding_challenge_2020

This project demonstrates one possible solution using `Python 3.6` with the in the requirements.txt defined packages.

<br/>

### How to run the script:
In a env with an executable Python interpreter, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
in order to have all needed packages installed. 

After that, it's simply executing the `main.py` in this directory:

``` 
python main.py
``` 

which should open an interactive web GUI (have a look at the printed output for detailed instructions).
